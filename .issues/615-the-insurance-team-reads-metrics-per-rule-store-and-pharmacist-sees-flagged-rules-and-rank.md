# 615 — The insurance team reads metrics per rule, store and pharmacist, sees flagged rules, and ranks payer rejections

## What to build

**Metrics** per rule, store, pharmacist and day (labelled "estimate" on SAR protected); **flags** with their
reason; the **rejection report** by code, payer and same kind, ranked by SAR, marking where a live guard exists.

**HQ contract:** the brief's sections for BackOffice 3141. Build against those shapes, stubbed in the drive; a shape the
BackOffice ticket changes is recorded in the brief and reconciled in the live-doors ticket.
