#
#
# THIS RUNNER LIVES IN A GIT WORKTREE
#
#   C:\Playground\oms-react-380   branch spec/380-ops-console   <- you are here
#   C:\Playground\oms-react       branch main                   <- a DIFFERENT checkout
#
# Both are checkouts of the same repository and share one object store. This runner and every
# session it starts must stay inside this directory. Never `cd` to the other tree, never edit
# it, and never `git checkout` a branch that is checked out over there - git refuses, and the
# refusal at 3am reads as a mysterious failure. Drives here bind port 5280, not 5199, so a
# server left running in the other tree cannot collide.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS RUNNER CANNOT WEDGE
#
# Piping `claude ... | ForEach-Object` straight into the console has three ways to look
# "stuck" forever. This runner closes all of them:
#
#  1. The child never inherits your console. It is launched with Start-Process, stdout and
#     stderr redirected to FILES, and stdin redirected from an EMPTY FILE - so it reads EOF
#     instantly and can never block waiting for input, and it can never emit an escape
#     sequence that clears or repaints your terminal. This script does all the printing,
#     from the parsed stream.
#  2. A STALL WATCHDOG. If no new stream line arrives for -StallMinutes (default 25), the
#     whole process TREE is killed with taskkill /T /F and the loop stops with a named
#     verdict. A hard per-session ceiling of -MaxHours (default 5) does the same.
#  3. A HEARTBEAT. Every 60 seconds of silence prints one line naming the tool still
#     running and how long it has been quiet, so the terminal is never blank-and-ambiguous.
#     A long quiet stretch under a "-> Bash npm run build" line is a build, not a hang.
#
# Also deliberate: no `2>&1` on a native exe (in PS 5.1 that wraps stderr in ErrorRecords
# and sets $? false on a clean exit 0), and the giant AFK system prompt travels as a FILE,
# never as a quoted command-line argument. The child still hands it to claude as ONE native
# arg, so it escapes every embedded double quote first (see the child runner below).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT EACH ROUND DOES
#
#   round A   claude -p "/implement <t>"                 -> commits the slice
#   round B   claude -p "/standards-review since <sha>"  -> read-only, writes
#             .afk\REVIEW-<t>.md and prints its verdict in this terminal
#
# <sha> is HEAD as it stood BEFORE round A, so the review sees exactly that ticket's diff.
# Round B never edits or commits; a failure there WARNS and the loop continues (the report
# is morning triage, not a gate). Round A failing stops the loop immediately.
#

# Dependency map (spec 380; nothing in the wave has landed yet):

#   S3 list:        393 + 383 --> 396 --> 397 --+-- 398 --+--> 400 --> 401

#   S4 details:     401 --> 402 --> 403 --> 404 --> 405
#   S5 simulation:  405 --> 406
#   S6 call center: 406 --> 407 --> 408 --> 409
#   NOT IN THIS RUN: 410 (Retry, waits on BackOffice BO-1), 411 (palette live search, BO-2)
#
# Running order:
#   * Ascending number IS a valid topological order, and it is also spec 380's step order
#     (ruling 361: foundation -> keyboard -> list -> details -> Simulation -> call center).
#     Keep it: the owner merges this branch back ONE STEP AT A TIME after signing each off,
#     so a later step must never land before an earlier one.
#   * 381 runs first on purpose: it rewrites the token table every later slice paints with,
#     and 385/386 rewrite AppShell, which 387-395 and 407 all extend.
#   * 410 and 411 are excluded: their endpoints are unfiled BackOffice asks. A stubbed
#     guess at an unbuilt contract is worse than no slice.
#
# Preconditions (the script checks 1, 2 and 4 - you own 3 and 5):
#   1. Nothing outside this wave blocks it.
#   2. No TRACKED modifications in the tree (untracked files are fine and only warn).
#   3. YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT BRANCH. This runner never switches branches - it commits onto
#      whatever is checked out now. Waves here are often built on a feature branch rather
#      than main, and the tickets themselves may only exist on that branch.
#      Expected for this wave: spec/380-ops-console (worktree C:\Playground\oms-react-380)
#   4. node_modules is installed (npm ci / npm install) - checked, because a missing install
#      turns every slice's typecheck into a wall of phantom errors at 3am.
#   5. A live SIS.Api on :5111 is NOT required - every drive stubs the network at Playwright with the shapes the reads return today. The prototype captures under .issues\assets\36x-37x-shots are approved and govern layout; the loop follows them and does not re-decide design.

You are running unattended (AFK) - there is no human available to answer questions.
Follow this protocol strictly:

1. NEVER call AskUserQuestion or wait for user input. It will hang the run.
2. When you hit a decision a human would normally weigh in on (naming, UX wording, copy,
   ambiguous spec detail, choice between reasonable approaches):
   - Pick the most conservative option consistent with the ticket/spec and repo conventions.
   - Log it to $hitlDoc (create the file if missing, append if it exists) as:
     ## Q: <the question>
     **Decision taken:** <what you chose>
     **Why:** <one line>
     **Revisit if:** <what would make this wrong>
   - Then continue working.
3. Wave-specific facts - read these before you code:
   - The spec is .issues\380-ops-console-rebuild-spec.md and the wayfinder map is
     .issues\358-ops-console-rebuild.md. Read the spec AND your ticket.
     No ticket of this wave had landed when this runner was generated. Read slices that landed earlier TONIGHT (git log on this branch) before re-deciding anything they settled.
   - YOU ARE IN A GIT WORKTREE at C:\Playground\oms-react-380 on branch spec/380-ops-console.
     Another checkout of this repository exists at C:\Playground\oms-react on main. Stay inside
     this directory: do not read from, write to, or cd into the other tree, and never
     `git checkout` a branch. Do not merge to main - the owner merges back, one step at a time.
   - THE DECISIONS ARE ALREADY TAKEN. Spec 380 states them with ids (F, K, L, D, M, C, R) and
     every ticket names the wayfinder tickets (359-379) whose `## Answer` holds the exact values,
     tables and measurements. Read those answers; they govern. The approved captures in
     .issues\assets\362-shots ... 379-shots govern layout. Do not re-decide design at 3am.
   - PROTOTYPE BRANCHES ARE READ-ONLY REFERENCE, NEVER MERGE OR CHERRY-PICK THEM:
     prototype/377-overlays (contains 362 tokens da08890 and 363 rail acd5564, plus 377),
     prototype/378-rtl, prototype/379-cc-rail (contains 373 sentence bdc24e7, plus 379),
     prototype/368-deliveries-list (variant A wins), prototype/371-delivery-details (variant D
     wins; its __prototype__/derive.ts has timeline/feed/dueTag), prototype/372-sim-waterfall
     (REJECTED design - facts only). Read them with `git show <branch>:<path>`. Their code is
     throwaway: dev bars, ?stub=1 switches, literal copy, useDismiss/useMedia. Lift values and
     decisions, rebuild to this repo's standards. Nothing under __prototype__ ships.
   - FONTS: the IBM Plex woff2 files are NOT on this branch yet. 381 takes exactly these seven from
     prototype/377-overlays with `git restore --source prototype/377-overlays -- <path>`:
     src/assets/fonts/ibm-plex-sans-latin-wght-normal.woff2, ibm-plex-mono-latin-{400,600}-normal,
     ibm-plex-sans-arabic-arabic-{400,500,600,700}-normal. Remove inter-latin-var and
     readexpro-arabic-var once nothing references them. NO @fontsource or any other npm package.
   - This wave adds NO npm dependency, NO feature folder, NO route and NO i18n namespace. Keys go
     in the existing namespaces: common, deliveries, document, callcenter, simulation.
   - REVERSALS - older text still says the old thing; the newer ruling wins:
     * "Cancellation requested" is INDIGO (082's --fam-cancel-request), NOT amber. 369's first
       text and the 368/371 prototypes draw amber. Amber stays reserved for attention.
     * Money and quantities stay in Plex SANS. Mono is for IDs and codes only (359). The Far
       prototype set amounts in mono - ignore that.
     * Toasts sit bottom-END (bottom-left under RTL), not today's top-right.
     * Delivery details keeps 083 D-10's command bar exactly: nothing hidden, NO More menu.
     * Simulation is a RETHEME ONLY: no price waterfall, no layout change (372).
     * The call center keeps ruling 153 whole: no single keys, no slash commands, and NO
       Ctrl+Enter place-order chord. A `terminal` command can never carry keys.
     * Recent stores the record NUMBER only, never a customer or a mobile.
   - NOT IN THIS RUN: 410 (Retry) and 411 (palette live search). Do not start, stub or half-build
     either. No retry-grant field on the OMS access probe, no quickFind API, no live-search
     group. The failed-job banner leaves ROOM for a button and renders none.
   - SHARED SURFACES - later slices extend what earlier slices built tonight; do not restructure:
     * 381 owns the token table in global.css. Token names stay 082's, so call sites do not
       change - EXCEPT 385's --sidebar* -> --rail* rename, which moves its contrast pairs too.
     * 385/386 own the new shell (AppShell). 387-395 and 407 extend it.
     * 392 creates @/core/commands (registry + palette). 393-409 register through useCommands;
       none of them adds a second palette or a second keydown layer.
     * 396 creates the pure timeline derivation in @/core. 397 and 402-405 consume and extend it;
       the inspector and Delivery details share the DERIVATION, not a component.
   - NAMED TRAPS (each was measured on a prototype; none is caught by a gate):
     * Once 381 moves the dark block under @media screen, check-contrast's `.dark {` regex must
       accept indentation, or the gate silently measures nothing for dark.
     * AG Grid `enableRtl` is @initial: set it once at boot via provideGlobalGridOptions (scalars
       only). A grid's own defaultColDef REPLACES a global one, so the bdi base renderer must be a
       core base that every defaultColDef spreads (383). An AG Grid React function renderer must
       return JSX - returning a DOM node throws. `Ltr` used as a cell renderer drops valueFormatter.
     * Isolate a range, pair or `n / m` as ONE value. Isolating each end still reverses it. The
       FSI helper is for string-only sinks and is NEVER used in grid values or exports (it would
       reach Ctrl+C and CSV).
     * A toast raised while a native <dialog> is open paints UNDER its backdrop and cannot be
       clicked. A dialog's own failure renders inside the dialog (390).
     * The list's Enter-opens belongs on the grid's onCellKeyDown (AG Grid preventDefaults Enter on
       a cell), and the key layer must skip event.defaultPrevented, or Enter in a token popover
       searches and then navigates away.
     * Match letters on event.code, not event.key - on an Arabic layout event.key is Arabic.
     * The next step's expectation uses the existing deliveryWindow(), never the raw schedule
       fields (a live capture has from = to).
     * Everything renders perfectly in English and wrong in Arabic. Drive each slice under
       dir="rtl" too. There is no Arabic locale file; drives use English strings under RTL and
       Arabic stub ROWS, as the prototypes did. Do not add Arabic copy.
   - SETTLED DEFAULTS FOR OPEN QUESTIONS (take these, log a HITL line, carry on):
     * 381: first check whether "Maximum update depth exceeded" appears on /oms/deliveries before
       you change anything; record it under ## Comments; fix it only if your slice causes it.
     * 404: the Attachments tab becomes a disclosure under Items with its file count.
     * Operator-lead acceptances and owner step sign-offs are OWNER items, never build blockers.
   - WHAT PROVEN MEANS HERE: pure modules (registry, fire-tier decision, palette gating, Recent,
     timeline, feed, lenses/counts, saved-view store, inspector clamp, sentence model, bidi
     formatting) get vitest tests. Gate changes (contrast pairs, the new grid-base gate) are proven
     by `npm run lint`. Every UI slice is proven by a tools\*-drive.mjs drive in light, dark AND
     RTL, network stubbed at Playwright. Extend the existing drives where one fits.

4. This repo's standing rules are non-negotiable - a violation is a review finding, not a taste
   difference. Read the rule file when your slice touches its area (.claude\rules\):
   - feature-structure: features/<area>/<feature>/ layout; features NEVER import features - only
     app and layout reach in. Adding a feature has a checklist; follow it rather than improvising
     a folder.
   - i18n-zero-literal: NO user-visible string literal anywhere. Every one goes through t(), with
     its key added to the en bundle. This is the single most common AFK slip, because a literal
     renders perfectly and only the lint gate catches it.
   - logical-tailwind: logical utilities only - ms/me/ps/pe/text-start/text-end - never
     ml/mr/pl/pr/left/right. The app renders RTL; a physical utility is silently wrong in Arabic
     and looks perfect in English.
   - api-envelope: every server call goes through src/core/api.ts. Do not hand-roll a fetch.
   - Path alias @/ maps to src/. Do not add deep relative import chains.
5. BATCH EXPLORATION - BUDGET THE ROUND TRIPS, NOT THE READING. Read as much of the repo as
   you need; under-reading is a worse failure than a slow session, and nothing here caps how
   much you look at. What is capped is the number of CALLS you spend looking.
   - One Bash call may carry MANY reads. `cat a.tsx b.tsx; sed -n '1,80p' c.ts; grep -n X d.ts`
     is ONE call, and it puts MORE context in front of you in a single view than four calls do -
     usually the better read, not just the faster one. Batch by DEFAULT; a lone single-file read
     is the exception.
   - Before a third consecutive single-file read, stop and batch the next ten into one call.
   - Genuinely sequential reads are fine: when file A tells you which file B to open, you could
     not have batched them. Never GUESS at B just to save a call.
   - DELEGATE WIDE SEARCHES, KEEP JUDGEMENT. If a question means sweeping many files or guessing
     at naming conventions ("where is this route registered", "what else uses this hook"), spawn
     ONE Explore subagent and keep its conclusion instead of walking the tree file by file. Do
     NOT delegate a question you must reason over in detail - a subagent returns a summary and
     the raw detail is lost. Correctness judgements, rules compliance and diff review stay yours.
   - Measured on a comparable wave: ~93 one-line reads per session, ~15 of every ~40 minutes of
     wall-clock, nearly all batchable. Round trips - not builds, not tests - dominate a long slice.
6. How to verify - a green typecheck is NOT proof a screen works:
   - `npm run typecheck` is the fast inner loop; run it continuously.
   - `npm test` is vitest (node environment, src/**/*.test.ts). React Testing Library is
     deliberately NOT installed: pure modules are where regression is silent, components are thin
     renderers. So do NOT add RTL or reach for a component-rendering test - that is a separate
     hardening ticket's call, not yours at 3am.
   - `npm run lint` runs three gates: import boundaries, token contrast, colour literals. Run it
     before you commit; it is what catches a stray literal or a raw hex colour.
   - `npm run build` once at the end.
   - A UI slice is proven by DRIVING THE APP with a Playwright script under tools\*-drive.mjs.
     That needs a vite server: start one on PORT 5280 (`npx vite --port 5280 --strictPort`; NOT
     5173 and NOT 5199 - the other checkout of this repo may hold either), run the drive with
     DRIVE_PORT=5280 in its environment, then KILL the server you started - BY THE PID LISTENING
     ON THE PORT (`(Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5280 -State Listen).OwningProcess`, then
     `taskkill /T /F /PID <pid>`), NEVER by matching 'vite' or '5280' in a process command line:
     your own claude.exe carries this whole prompt on its command line, so that match kills YOU
     and the slice dies uncommitted (ticket 401 died exactly that way). Playwright is borrowed from C:/Playground/frontend/node_modules via a createRequire
     shim in the drive files - it is not a dependency of this repo. Follow an existing drive file
     rather than inventing a new harness.
   - If a drive genuinely cannot run (it needs a live SIS.Api that is not up, or Playwright does
     not resolve), that is an OUTSTANDING PROOF, not a blocker and never something to fake: stub
     the network at Playwright where the ticket allows it, otherwise leave the Proof box unticked,
     say exactly why in the ticket, and finish the rest of the slice.
   - Pre-existing baseline for this wave, measured when this runner was generated -
     anything at or below this is NOT yours to fix:
     * npm run typecheck: CLEAN. Any error you see is yours.
     * npm test: CLEAN - 166 test files, 3133 tests, all passing.
     * npm run lint: all three gates CLEAN (boundaries 714 files, contrast 129 pairs, palette 719
       files with 5 documented exclusions). The pair count will change in 381/385 by design.
7. Proof checkboxes marked OWNER, manual-smoke, or needing a live backend are NOT yours: leave them
   unchecked, list them as outstanding in the ticket, and never fake or simulate them. In this wave
   that is the owner's live sign-off of each step (S1 at 391, S2 at 395, S3 at 401, S4 at 405, S5 at 406, S6 at 409), the operator lead's acceptances (400's default view running on open, 407's console in the shell, 409's caller bar), and any Proof box that needs a live SIS.Api or a human eye on Arabic rendering. The ticket may still complete AFK with those open; every OTHER
   Proof box must be real, written, and green.
8. Finish the /implement skill's own review step (built-in /code-review, then /standards-review)
   before you close the ticket. An INDEPENDENT /standards-review runs in a separate session right
   after this one against $baseSha, and its report lands in .afk\REVIEW-$t.md - so leave the commit
   in a state you would be happy to have reviewed cold.
9. Stage NARROWLY when you commit: your slice's files only. Do not commit .afk\ artifacts, drive
   screenshots, dist\, or anything you did not write for this ticket. Commit onto the CURRENT
   branch; never switch or create a branch.
10. BLOCKER = you cannot proceed safely at all: the spec contradicts itself, a required file or
    dependency is missing or unfetchable, the tickets are not on this branch, a slice would need a
    new npm dependency, or any choice risks breaking unrelated shipped behavior. On a blocker:
    - Log it to $hitlDoc under '## BLOCKER: <title>' with what you tried and what a human must
      decide.
    - STOP: do not complete the ticket, do not commit, leave the working tree in a clean
      understandable state, and end your final message with the exact line: AFK-BLOCKED
11. On success, the VERY LAST line of your final message must be exactly: AFK-DONE
    Nothing after it - no closing thought, no note for the next slice, no sign-off. Write whatever
    summary you like ABOVE it, then that line alone.
12. Do not push and do not open a PR. Committing is allowed only if the /implement skill itself
    says to commit.

You are running unattended (AFK) - there is no human available to answer questions. NEVER call

You are reviewing ONLY the diff introduced by ticket $t of spec 380: git diff $baseSha...HEAD.
The fixed point is $baseSha - do not ask for one, do not widen the range.

This session is READ-ONLY with exactly one exception (the report file):
- Do NOT edit source, tests, .issues tickets or INDEX.md. Do NOT commit, stage, stash, revert or
  push ANYTHING. Do not run a drive that writes screenshots into the tree; reading the code and
  the diff is the job. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` are fine - they write nothing.
- Write your full two-axis report (Standards and Spec) to $reviewDoc, overwriting it if present.
  Head it with the ticket number, the fixed point, and a one-line VERDICT: CLEAN, MINOR, or
  SERIOUS.
- Findings must be concrete: file:line, the rule or the spec line it violates, and what the fix
  would be. Say plainly when an axis is clean rather than manufacturing findings.
- Check every standing rule in .claude\rules\, and pay particular attention to the two that pass

  the wayfinder answers (359-379) and spec 380's F/K/L/D/M/C ids are the source of truth, the
  approved captures govern layout; no new npm dependency, namespace, route or feature folder;
  cancellation requested is indigo, money is sans and only IDs are mono, toasts bottom-end;
  the 083 command bar is unchanged (no More menu); Simulation is a retheme only; 153 stands in
  the call center (no single keys, no place-order chord, terminal commands carry no keys);
  nothing from __prototype__ ships; no physical left/right utility and no un-isolated range,
  pair or count under RTL; every grid spreads the core base defaultColDef; one command layer
  in @/core/commands, never a second keydown listener; nothing of 410/411 is started;
  Proof boxes needing the owner, an operator lead or a live SIS.Api stay honestly unticked.

Then in your FINAL message print, in under 15 lines: the VERDICT word, the count of findings per
axis, and one line per SERIOUS finding. End your final message with the exact line:
